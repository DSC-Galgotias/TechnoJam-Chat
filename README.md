**Note: As many users new to firebase were facing issue without the google-services.json file, 
the file has now been added to the project directory.**

If you want to use your own Firebase project, follow [these](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
instructions for manually adding your `google-services.json` file in the `app` module.
