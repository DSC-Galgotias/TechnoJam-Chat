DigitalOcean started Hacktoberfest with a simple mission in mind: to give back to the open source community that had given us and many other companies so much. We combined our customers’ love of our swag with a challenge: contribute meaningfully to projects and earn a limited edition t-shirt. Five years later, more than 100,000 developers from 120 countries have participated, contributing nearly 400,000 pull requests to almost 100,000 repositories. We’re back for another year and officially welcome you to our fifth annual celebration of open source in partnership with GitHub and Twilio!
